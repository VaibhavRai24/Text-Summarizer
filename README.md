# Text Summarization System

## 📋 **Project Overview**
This project is an AI-based text summarization system designed to generate concise and meaningful summaries from lengthy textual content. It can be used for applications like document analysis, news summarization, and content extraction from research papers.

---
## 🎯 **Key Features**
- **Automatic Summarization:** Generates extractive or abstractive summaries from text inputs.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Quick generation of summaries for large documents.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple input for pasting text or uploading files.
- **Custom Length Control:** Allows users to specify the length of the desired summary.

---
## 🛠 **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow/Keras (if custom models used)
- **Natural Language Processing:** NLTK, spaCy, BERT-based models
- **Web Framework (if applicable):** Streamlit / Flask
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
